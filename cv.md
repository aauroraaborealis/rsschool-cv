### Brief Self-Introduction

 I'm 19 years old, and I'm currently studying software engineering at university. I'm also pursuing front-end web development at RS School. Before this, I was involved in developing augmented reality (AR) experiences for Instagram, which is what sparked my passion for programming and JavaScript.  
  
My goal is to become a JavaScript professional, crafting beautiful and engaging web applications that bring value and joy to people. Additionally, I aspire to delve into the fundamentals of design, especially UX, to better understand how to effectively arrange and present information to users.  
  
I excel in problem-solving and have a keen eye for detail. My dedication and strong work ethic drive me to continuously improve my skills and adapt to new challenges. I'm a fast learner, always eager to explore the latest technologies and programming languages to stay at the forefront of the field.
